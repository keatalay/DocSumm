Although environmental degradation and climate change do not bode well for any of the world’s inhabitants, the destruction of the environment has placed the global poor in a uniquely precarious situation. Indeed, dependence by the world’s poor on the most “climate-sensitive sectors” and limited capacity of developing country governments to “provide social safety nets” and invest in “basic infrastructure aimed at disaster preparedness and relief” make clear that climate change has the potential to devastate poor populations throughout the world, particularly those in Africa and Asia. The poor will be affected both directly and indirectly by climate change. Direct impacts will include changes in agricultural productivity caused by changes in rainfall, the “inundation of cities and infrastructure due to sea level rise” and higher probability of disease. Equally problematic yet less easily predictable effects, such as intense volatility in the prices of vital resources, will also be numerous. The effects of climate change will compound the challenges that many in the global south already face. In Africa, warming is expected to “be above the global annum mean warming throughout  the continent and in all seasons,” exacerbating the already significant issues of water stress and food security on the continent. Warming in all of Asia will be likely cause “an increase in frequency of intense precipitation events. . .partly associated with likely increase in tropical cyclone intensity.” 

The disparity between wealthy and impoverished nations in the vulnerability to dangers posed by environmental degradation leads some to suggest rapid economic development as a solution. Indeed, two out of the three three primary features of developing countries that render them uniquely vulnerable are influenced significantly by economic growth. These factors are the higher economic sensitivity of the poor to climate events and the lower adaptive capacity of poor communities to deal with climate stress. Because the ability for countries to “absorb climate stress” depends largely on factors that are “highly correlated with economic growth,” including possessing strong institutions, effective health and sanitation systems, “high levels of education and a well-developed financial sector, ” it seems that both can presumably be dealt with through economic development initiatives. 

However, traditional economic development models risk entering a country into the so-called “paradox of development.” It is true that, as countries grow their economies, their capacity to insulate themselves from the ill effects of climate change and environmental degradation are improved. Yet, it is also true that “income gains throughout the world have occurred largely in step” with increased energy consumption and, therefore, carbon emissions. Thus, as one country’s population reaps the rewards of economic growth, the global population and the environment as a whole are put at further risk. It is therefore clear that in order to alleviate poverty without exacerbating environmental degradation, new development schemes must be developed. These programs should abide by three basic principles if they are to be successful in simultaneously combatting poverty and environment-related insecurity. First, they should avoid contributing negatively to existing environmental problems or introduce new ones. Second, they should link adaptive and mitigative approaches to dealing with climate change. Third, they should seek to enhance local knowledge of the impacts of climate change and make capital for small-scale adaptive measures available. Finally, they should apply a “mainstreaming” approach, which links human welfare and “its various social and human dimensions” to issues related to the environment. 


Despite the obvious harm that traditional development schemes often cause to the environment, the relatively quick economic benefits that they can offer render them extremely tempting options for Bank officials and host governments. The types of initiatives that fall under “traditional development” in this case include many programs that aim to develop industry. Such programs include those which advise countries to make changes meant to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), initiatives meant to develop industrial agricultural practices, programs which aim to develop non-renewable energy production infrastructure, and many others. Currently, despite claiming to have assigned environmental preservation as a top priority, the Bank continues to support development projects that are harmful to the environment. A notable recent example is the $3.75 billion loan the World Bank offered South Africa in 2010 for the purpose of developing a coal-fired power plant. The loan was made and the project initiated despite internal opposition to the plant. 

Energy production is a particularly troubling sector as the potential for large-scale environment-friendly energy production throughout much of the world is relatively low. Bank officials have expressed their frustration in this area, with Bank president Jim Yong Kim publicly insisting that the Bank is making an effort to avoid investments in coal and other non-renewables, but that the Bank’s role as “the group of last resort in finding needed energy in countries that are desperately in search of it” must often take precedent over its role as a global environmental preservationist. The difficulty of implementing sustainable energy production programs in the developing world is apparent, yet it should not preclude at least partial utilization of existing alternatives to non-renewable energy, including solar and wind power, which have been used successfully elsewhere.

Another sector that demands innovation is agriculture. The imposition of industrialized agricultural techniques throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty first have had positive and negative impacts. Despite increasing crop yields in many cases, industrial monocultural practices have damaged farm land, caused a dependency on foreign technology, left many farmers in debt, and rendered agricultural production in many countries acutely vulnerable to drought, pests and other naturally occurring threats. Industrialized agriculture is also less water efficient and has a substantially larger carbon footprint than non-industrial alternatives, thus it is counterproductive in the effort to reduce global carbon emissions. The allure of high-yielding cash crops has faded as awareness of the potential damage that industrial agricultural can cause grows. The implementation of such agricultural techniques in Morocco are illustrative. Starting in the middle of the twentieth century, the use of “use of nitrogen fertilizer, mechanization, and the heavy use of irrigation (surface water and groundwater)” were introduced for the purpose of increasing cereal production. Despite leading to increased yields in years with sufficient rain, the industrialization of Moroccan agriculture left it at substantially more sensitive to drought. As stated earlier, climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts throughout much of the world and particularly in Africa. Thus, it is clear that alternative agricultural techniques must be introduced, especially in areas that are at elevated risk. 

Because much of the developed world possesses the material capacity to absorb a relatively large amount of damage caused by the immediate threats posed by climate change, programs to contend with global warming have tended to focus more on mitigation of global warming and its effects than adaptation to them. For much of the developing world, however, policies designed to mitigate the effects of climate change are not an option. These areas have instead been host to initiatives meant to enhance their adaptive capacities to deal with climate change and other environmental problems. Because of the distinct relevance of the mitigative and adaptive approaches to different parts of the world, the two have been treated by most policy makers as separate policy areas. For a variety of reasons, the result of approaching the two separately has been the allocation of overwhelmingly greater effort and resources to the development of mitigative policy approaches. The fact that climate change is already having a demonstrable impact on much of the world makes clear that adaptive measures must be implemented. One way of lessening the disparity in attention devoted to much-needed adaptive measures is to adopt an approach that seeks to integrate mitigation and adaptation when possible. Projects undertaken recently in Bangladesh also suggest that there exist significant synergies between the two policy approaches. Thus the combination of mitigation and adaptation will not only devote increased attention to the needs of the developing world, but will likely also enhance the effectiveness of projects undertaken globally to deal with climate change.

The work of the NGO Waste Concern in Bangladesh is evidence of the viability of a dual mitigative-adaptive approach. The organization initiated a composting program in Dakha, in which trained “waste pickers” collected organic waste and, instead of depositing it in landfills where they would produce methane, dumped it at composting plants where it was used to create biofertilizers. The mitigative aspect of the project, reduced methane emissions, is complemented by the numerous adaptive components, which include the creation of fertilizers which will “increase the moisture retention and fertility of soil,” effectively reducing its vulnerability to drought. The program was also designated a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). CDM is a “market-based initiative under the Kyoto Protocol,” which allows countries with greenhouse gas reduction targets to “generate emissions ‘credits’ from projects that offset emissions. . .and produce sustainable developments.” Despite the eventual success of the program, initially, the notion that climate-change initiatives with mitigative elements are ill-suited to the developing world made it difficult for Waste Concern to secure funding. It is in this area that the World Bank can have a potentially enormous impact. If the Bank were to prioritize mixed mitigative-adaptive development initiatives, it could function as an immensely valuable source of funding for further research in this area. More robust implementation of adaptive-mitigative programs would, as mentioned earlier, have the dual effect of increasing the global focus on aiding in the development of the global south’s adaptive capacity, and, through the implementation of programs with a mitigative component, helping to ensure that developing countries limit carbon emissions as their economies develop.

Despite the fact that global warming is poised to have tremendous effects on developing countries throughout the world, many of the people who will be most impacted remain unaware of how they will be effected and of how to adapt to impending changes. Educating these people is an inexpensive policy option that has shown itself to be extremely successful. The impact of awareness is shown to be enhanced when coupled with access to capital for the purpose of implementing small-scale adaptive measures. Studies conducted in Ethiopia and Nepal affirm the value of education and capital as tools in insulating the poor from the effects of climate change.

Ethiopia is hugely dependent upon its agricultural sector, which accounts for 40% of its national GDP, 90% of exports and 85% of its employment. Agricultural production in Ethiopia has already begun to be impacted by climate change, yet the impacts have been felt in varying degrees of severity by different segments of its population. A 2005 study which assessed the knowledge of 1,000 farming households regarding climate change, and recorded any measures they had taken to adapt to it, found that access to information regarding global warming, and the implementation of adaptive measures improved food security of Ethiopian farmers. The adaptation strategies that were utilized were relatively easy to implement and were mostly non-reliant on difficult to access technology. The lack of education and access to capital, however, were major hurdles to their implementation. Indeed, over 90% of respondents who said they had not taken any adaptive measures “indicated lack of information, land, money, and shortages of labor, as major reasons” for not doing so. Lack of information was the most commonly cited reason, with 40-50% of households reporting it as the primary reason for implementing adaptive measures. Access to credit was also found to be a significant factor, as “farm households with access to credit” were found to “be more likely to adapt to climate change.” Because those who lacked access to education and capital tended to be worse off to begin with, the benefit of access to both was found to be greater “for those who did not adapt than the negative impact that non-adaptation would have had on those who had,” thus, information and financial resources were found to be uniquely valuable to the most vulnerable. The study’s findings are affirmed by another study conducted in Nepal, where it was discovered that absence of information and credit led farmers to employ options which actually yielded deleterious effects. In response to crop failure caused by climate change, Nepali farmers were found to employ coping strategies such as “labor migration, using children at work and increasing consumption of loans” which appeared to push “poor communities toward indebtedness and a vicious cycle of poverty with additional vulnerabilities and risks.” 

The potential benefit that a concerted effort by the World Bank to educate and extend affordable credit to poor farmers threatened by climate change could provide is tremendous. The implementation of these types of programs would be relatively easy to carry out and would not be particularly expensive. Integrating education and the extension of capital to poor communities into the Bank’s environmental program more broadly would also push the Bank toward adopting another extremely useful policy guideline: applying a “mainstreaming approach” to combatting climate change.

As stated earlier, a country’s level of economic development is closely related to its ability to withstand the impacts of environmental degradation. The interrelatedness of economic and environmental conditions makes clear that many of the areas that the World Bank focuses on in attempting to alleviate poverty are directly connected to environmental factors. For the Bank to most effectively prepare the global poor for the effects of climate change, it must apply a “mainstreaming approach” to its efforts in the environmental arena. This would involve linking “human welfare and its various social and human dimensions to environmental issues,” and employing methods of addressing problems in both areas simultaneously. The linkages between the two policy areas are numerous. The significance of social protection schemes, access to credit and crop and livestock insurance in enhancing food security is one example. The impacts of access to basic services including “agricultural extension, cooperatives, education and health” on a society’s adaptive capacity is another. A study conducted by Kirsten Halsaes and Sara Traerup, in which examples of mainstreaming program planning in Mozambique and Tanzania are provided, illustrates how such an approach might be executed by the Bank.

The authors of the study identified areas where the effects of climate change would have notable impacts on a variety of other factors, in this case, infrastructure in Mozambique and public health in Tanzania. In Mozambique, the authors focused on the Limpopo Basin, a region that has already experienced increases in the frequency and severity of flooding due to global warming. The authors identified sectors that would be impacted by the intensification of this trend, highlighting the effects that increased flooding would have on road access. Impediments to travel on roads in the Limpopo Basin will affect the transport of basic supplies, including food and medicine, likely lead to increases in the prices of food, and cause massive displacement of the area’s inhabitants. Traerup and Halsaes recommend the construction of drainage systems, the elevation of roads, the construction of alternative routes and shoring up of road foundations and bridges to handle increased flooding. In Tanzania, the authors identify the link between increased climate variability and the incidence of malarial infections, pointing out that changes in the Tanzanian climate will cause “the distribution of malaria” to be “extended into new areas” of the country. Traerup and Halsaes note that malarial infection has numerous direct costs, related primarily to measures required to treat and prevent infection, and indirect costs, including wage loss and the costs of “caretakers, school absenteeism and delayed investment opportunities.” Ultimately, the authors recommend the application of known malaria prevention techniques, including spraying the interiors of houses with insecticide and the administration of malaria vaccine, in areas that are likely to be impacted. 

The value of a mainstreaming approach will be felt in both the short to medium and long terms. In the short to medium term, such an approach facilitates advanced planning regarding the potential for environmental changes to impact other sectors and vice versa. Major environmental changes can occur in as short a time as only a few years and can have far-reaching implications, therefore an approach that actively takes these changes into consideration is extremely beneficial. In the long term, encouraging a more integrative approach to all development program planning will likely cause the benefits yielded by development initiatives to persist in the face of environmental changes caused by climate change, as they will be designed with these changes in mind.
